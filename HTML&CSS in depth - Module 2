The browser window that is visible to the user on the screen is called the Viewport.
One important property is Display. This property specifies the type of box that you want to use for a given HTML element.
#sample {
  display: block;
}
Flexbox(short for Flexible box model) was introduced before the grid layout. It adds float elements and positioning. 
#sample {
  display: flex;
}
CSS Grid is similar to the Flexbox, except it creates a two dimensional grid along both the row and column axes. 
#sample {
  display: grid;
}
Flexbox can overcome the limitations caused by containers such as block and inline because it does a better job of 
scaling over larger web pages and also provides more dynamic control of the containers.This is because it can grow, 
shrink and align the items inside it which give better control to the programmer over the contents and styling of the 
items inside the container. 
Flexbox is single-dimensional, which means you can align it either along a row or a column and it is set to row 
alignment by default.There are two axes, the main and cross-axis, much like the x and y-axis used in coordinate geometry. 
When aligned along the row, the horizontal axis is called the main axis and the vertical axis is called the cross axis.

Three commonly used Flexbox elements:
1. Search Bar. You can use Flexbox for search bars because it ties up all the elements, such as the small seach icon, 
the search input area, and the submit button. 
2. Navigation Bar. Flexbox makes your navigation bar highly responsive on different devices. 
3. Image Gallery. Flexbox realigns itself when you change the size of the window. 

* is the uniersal selector in CSS. It applies the rules to every element in CSS code.
